    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to tie vggish points back to their annotations. We do this in 5 major steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We pull the most recent annotation file for each image. This was created in a previous script called \"unique_images_annotations.ipynb\". Run it now to generate the csv by the same name which is required for this script.\n",
    "2. Opening the most recent JSON for each image we get the annotations and their coordinates.\n",
    "3. Each annotated image has an associated file number. These file numbers directly relate to the windows covered e.g., file-0 covers from 0 to 1 minute of time in original audio, file-1 covers from minute 1 to minute 2 of original audio, etc. We will use these file numbers to get the spectrogram start time in seconds.\n",
    "4. To find where each noise specifically happened we pull the coordinates of the annotations. By finding how far the annotation started and ended in the spectrogram and knowing that each spectrogram accounts for a minute, we can get the start and end time of a sound in seconds.\n",
    "5. Finally, we need to match these annotation start and stop times back to the VGGish points. We know that each VGGish point accounts for 0.96 seconds of raw audio time, so dividing the start and stop sound times by 0.96 will give us which slice each belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: We start by loading basic Python libraries and files for use (the unique image annotations file noted above, as well as the mapping file which ties wav filenames back to the shortened labels for VGGish's output)."
