## Pull requests submitted to make changes to the main branch should come from the dev-vgg branch.

## Please list all needed libraries in the requirements.txt file in this directory

- Will add libraries to the environment.yml file in the highest level of the hydrophanatics directory as needed. Please do not make changes directly to the environment.yml file at the highest level of the directory

## If you would like to create an environment.yml for local development purposes, please create one in the vggish directory. Recommend changing the "name" field within the environment.yml to something besides hydrophonatics
